# ImagePlanner
Windows Astro-imaging Planning Tool utilizing TheSky Pro

Overview

Image Planner is a Windows application that generates calendars to forecast daily object imaging availability for a given astronomical object and year.  The application utilizes TSX for basic object and location information.  Image Planner 3.0 is a follow-on to Image Forecast 2.0.  The latter version added two new windows: A target altitude window that displays the altitude of the target over the selected night and information about the moon position, and a is a target image window that shows the DSS2 image (uploaded from www.sky-map.org) of the target inside a box which represents the userâ€™s currently active imager FOV in TheSkyX.  This third version adds yet another pop-up window for selecting potential targets on whichever date has been selected.
 
Details on usage and installation can be found in the ImagePlanner/publish/ImagePlanner.pdf.
